## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

### Notes

```
/app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.

/app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.

/app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.

/public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.

/scripts: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.
Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.
```

## layouts and pages

- page.tsx : special next.js file exports a react component. Only this is public
- layout.tsx : to create UI that is shared between multiple pages, partial rendering!

## client side component

- hooks, use\*

## Server Side components

- Allows use of sql directly to query

## redering

### static rendering

With static rendering, data fetching and rendering happens on the server at build time (when you deploy) or during revalidation. The result can then be distributed and cached in a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Whenever a user visits your application, the cached result is served. There are a couple of benefits of static rendering:

- Faster Websites - Prerendered content can be cached and globally distributed. This ensures that users around the world can access your website's content more quickly and reliably.

- Reduced Server Load - Because the content is cached, your server does not have to dynamically generate content for each user request.

- SEO - Prerendered content is easier for search engine crawlers to index, as the content is already available when the page loads. This can lead to improved search engine rankings.

Static rendering is useful for UI with no data or data that is shared across users, such as a static blog post or a product page. It might not be a good fit for a dashboard that has personalized data that is regularly updated.

### dynamic rendering - limited by the server request

With dynamic rendering, content is rendered on the server for each user at request time (when the user visits the page). There are a couple of benefits of dynamic rendering:

- Real-Time Data - Dynamic rendering allows your application to display real-time or frequently updated data. This is ideal for applications where data changes often.

- User-Specific Content - It's easier to serve personalized content, such as dashboards or user profiles, and update the data based on user interaction.

- Request Time Information - Dynamic rendering allows you to access information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL search parameters.

## STREAMING! - move data fetching down to component level, use suspense

Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smaller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready.

By streaming, you can prevent slow data requests from blocking your whole page. This allows the user to see and interact with parts of the page without waiting for all the data to load before any UI can be shown to the user.

- skeleton component
- suspense
- react group (folder)
